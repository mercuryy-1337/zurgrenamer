# zurgrenamer
a python script that automates the renaming of files through zurg's webdav
## Usage?
### This script isn't intended to be run as-is!</br>
It serves as a template that people should customise to fit their specific use case. Since everyone has different torrents and file naming conventions, the mappings provided are only for testing purposes.</br>
I'll later incorporate it into [DebridMedioOrganiser](https://github.com/mercuryy-1337/DebridMediaOrganiser) so i don't have to deal with symlinks anymore. </br>

### Yowmamasita is the goat
S/o to [yow](https://github.com/yowmamasita) for adding the renaming functionality, with more things to come.
